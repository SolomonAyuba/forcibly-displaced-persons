# DATASETS
# The refugees package includes 8 datasets:
# population: Data on forcibly displaced and stateless persons by year, 
  # including refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced people (IDPs) and 
  # stateless people. Detailed definitions of the different population groups 
  # can be found on the methodology page of the Refugee Data Finder.
# idmc: Data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre on the total 
  # number of IDPs displaced due to conflict and violence.
# asylum_applications: Data on asylum applications including the procedure type
  # and application type.
# asylum_decisions: Data on asylum decisions, including recognitions, 
  # rejections, and administrative closures.
# demographics: Demographic and sub-national data, where available, including 
  # disaggregation by age and sex.
# solutions: Data on durable solutions for refugees and IDPs.
# unrwa: Data on registered Palestine refugees under UNRWAâ€™s mandate.
# flows: Numbers of the people forced to flee during each of the years since 
  # 1962. For more information, see the explanation of the forced displacement
  # flow dataset.

#WORKING ON THE POPULATION DATAFRAME
#Explore the dataframe briefly to understand its structure

#Get the first few rows of the dataset
head(population_df)

#View the structure of the dataset
str(population_df)

#Get the summary/descriptive statistics of the dataset
summary(population_df)

#Check the shape/dimension(rows, columns) of the dataframe
dim(population_df)


#Data Cleaning

#Check for missing values in the dataframe
colSums(is.na(population_df))

#The oip column has 126,286 missing values out of 126,402 (about 99% missing values). It's best to drop the column.
population_df <- subset(population_df, select = -oip)

#Check for missing values again
colSums(is.na(population_df))
